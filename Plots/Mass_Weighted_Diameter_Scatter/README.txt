Here are two plots, both have a scatter plot with the mass weighted diameter against the rainfall rate for all sampling periods with the 1 minute data.

Both plots have a fit with power law to the data, same method that Elisa used. The best distribution is also plotted.

One plot has the first droplet bin ommited and the other does not.
